                A Zoetrope is a rudimentary animation device invented in the 1800's. The frames of animation are printed on the interior of a rotating cylinder. The cylinder itself has slits cut out so that a viewer may observe the frame directly oposite the slit. When rotated at high speed the slits appear to not move while frames pass in and out of view in a continuous loop.

                GSAP (which stands for Green Sock Animation Platform) is an animation and tweening library for JavaScript, allowing for more fine-tuned control over animations beyond the CSS animation facility. The library can be closely integrated with ScrollMagicâ€” another JS library that simplifies complex scroll behavior, using the tweening mechanic afford by GSAP.

                Tweening (of course, not done by hand) has always mistified me since I first saw the effects of automatic tweening in Adobe Flash. 
                Under its core, it's just some coordinate interpolation, but ther results can vary so widely to shockingly natural to weirdly floaty. In the vein of previous formal web-studies I'd done, I wanted to see how GSAP's tweening keeps up with "natural" motion paths i.e. Human locamotion

                Eadweard Muybridge, was a 19th century photographer, who was deeply influential in the development of animation nad motion pictures. He's best known for his development of the Zoopraxiscope, a crude motion picture projector involving a rotation disk, and his perfected process of capturing the motion of fast moving animals. His numerous motion studies of both humans and animals, we widely used in science and animation as physical references.
